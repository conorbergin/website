## What do we mean by CAD?
- specify geometry
- verify and test designs with simulation
- outut for 3d printers

It is not that useful to have a nice image rendered on our screens, we want to mill, cast, fold, print, stamp our designs. You will hear the expression "Digital Twin" a lot these days if you are invovled in any sort of manufacturing.

### CSG

### BRep

### F-Rep
This is one for the mathematicians, instead of spending all our time stitching together surfaces and.
