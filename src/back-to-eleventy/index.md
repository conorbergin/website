My Sveltekit blog, despite its advantages, was making me uncomfortable. I was doing something I didn't quite understand to process my markdown files as a build step, that I had copied of the internet. Svelte 5 is out and I don't really care about frameworks any more, so I am unwilling to read about the differences. Eleventy is better for making blogs and small websites because it only used for making blogs and small websites, all the documentation and plugins are aimed at people making blogs and small websites. If html didn't require you to wrap every paragraph in ```<p></p>``` I would consider working on the site in pure html.
